<p>Before you can start predicting the matches, you will first need to pay <i>your local UNICEF champion</i>.</p>
<p>
    Predict the following aspects of each game:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The half time score</li>
    <li>The full time score</li>
    <li>The number of yellow cards</li>
    <li>The number of red cards</li>
    <li>The teams advancing to the final round(s)</li>
</ol>

<p>During the group matches, points are awarded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <footer>Example:</footer>
    <p>You predicted 0-2 during half time and 1-3 after full time for a certain match. Also you predicted 0 red cards and 3 yellow cards. The final score turned out to be 0-0 during half time and 0-2 after full time and no red cards and no yellow cards were shown. You have scored 2 points for indicating the correct winner and 1 point for the correctly guessing the number of red cards, so a total of 3 points.</p>

<p>Please note that the moment the match starts, the scores for that match will be frozen and all the valid predictions will be shown on the match page.</p>

<p>You are also able to predict who will go through the next round(s) during the group phase. You will need to submit those teams before the first match is played. So you will need to predict who will go to the Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, 3rd place match and Final. The points for correctly predicting which team advances are:</p>

<blockquote>
    <footer>Example:</footer>
    <p>When you selected 10 out of the possible 16 teams going to the round of 16 correctly, you receive 50 points. When another 8 of those are correct in the quarter finals, you will receive another 80 points. You will receive another 45 points if 3 of those reach the semi-final. Correctly predicting the tournament winner will bring you a lot of points: 25 for being in the final and another 50 for the championship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the matches in the final rounds are available, you are able to enter your predictions. This means you will need to keep track of your predictions during the last rounds. The system is set up in such a way that you can select any of the teams in the final rounds – regardless of you have selected them in an earlier round or not. So your world cup winner does not have to be one of your finalists.</p>

<p>After each match is played, the rankings will be recalculated and they will be shown on the <a href="/">homepage</a> and the <a href="/Rankings/">rankings</a> page.</p>
